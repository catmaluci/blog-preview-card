## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** - For structuring the card's content
- **CSS3** - For all styling and responsive design
- **Flexbox** - For clean and centered layout
- **Google Fonts** - For typography

## My Process 🛠️
### 1. HTML Structure 📋
I created a semantic HTML structure with:
- `<img>` for the blog post image
- `<span class="tag">` for the "Learning" tag
- `<h2>` for the title
- `<p>` for the description
- `<footer>` for author information

### 2. Styling 🎨
- **Mobile-first approach** 📱
- **Typography**: Imported and applied custom fonts
- **Layout**: Used `display: flex` with `flex-direction: column`
- **Colors**: Managed with CSS custom properties (variables) 🎨
- **Interactive States**: Implemented `:hover` effect

### 3. Interactive Elements ⚡
- Added **hover effects** on interactive elements
- Title and author's name turn **yellow** on hover 🟡
- Card "lifts" with a subtle **box-shadow transition** ✨

## 📚 What I Learned
- **Semantic HTML** for better accessibility ♿
- **Flexbox** for responsive layouts 📐
- **Advanced CSS pseudo-classes** (`:hover`) 
- **Attention to detail** in design implementation 🎯
